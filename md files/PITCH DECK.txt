HOSTEL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM - PITCH DECK

Tagline:
Run hostel operations like a top-tier institution: faster bookings, cleaner records, fewer conflicts, and higher revenue visibility.

Founder Credibility:
This system was built from over 7 years of practical experience managing one of the biggest hostels in Nigeria. It is designed from real operational pain points, not theory.

==================================================
SLIDE 1 - THE PROBLEM
==================================================
Most schools and hostel operators still manage critical operations with:
- Paper records and spreadsheets
- Manual room allocation
- Poor payment tracking
- Slow complaint handling
- No live occupancy visibility
- Weak control over managers and staff

Result:
- Revenue leakage
- Student/parent dissatisfaction
- Double bookings and disputes
- Delayed decision-making
- Poor scalability across multiple hostels

==================================================
SLIDE 2 - THE SOLUTION
==================================================
Our Hostel Management System digitizes the complete accommodation lifecycle:
- Room and bed-space inventory management
- Student booking and payment workflows
- Approval pipelines for managers and admin
- Complaint and support tracking
- Hostel change and room change request workflows
- Centralized analytics and control for owners/admins

This is an operational control platform for serious hostel businesses and institutions.
